Problem Statement:
* Extract tables in DWG file.
* Put them in excel file

Solutions:
* Parse the table inside DWG file. (Difficult)
    * get the boundary of the column name.

* Convert DWG to PDF and use existing PDF Parser libraries (Easy)
    ** use _exportpdf command in Bricscad to convert DWG to PDF.
    ** use camelot to get the data from the Table inside the PDF.
    ** parse the inside the output.

ALGORITHM PSUEDO CODE:

ask for a list of column names
for each column_name
    for entity in modelspace
        if MTEXT/TEXT Entity TextString == column_name
            if not MTEXT/TEXT Entity TextString already is already a key in dictionary

            else

            {MTEXT/TEXT Entity.position : []}
            vpt1, vpt2 = get the vertical boundary points for that entity
            for each entity in modelspace
                if Entity is MTEXT or TEXT and vpt1 < entity.position < vpt2
                    dict = {entity.TextString: entity.position}


{"NO.": [{"1": (x,y)},{"2": (x,y)},{"3": (x,y)}]}

I think parsing the table is very difficult!!!
how will parse these lines to form a table and cells, with rows and columns.

how to tell if its a box? -> a box is made up of 4 points.

table - BIG BOX (algorithm to scan all boxes and determine who is the biggest of them all)
    cell - small box within
        row - y position of the cell within the table
        column - x position of the cell within the table
