1. SectionPropertyScript

    * iter_input()
2. Pre-Processor
    * create_geometry(model_space)
    * create_mesh(geometry, mesh_size)

3. Solver

4. Post-Processor
    * get_properties(cross_section)
    * create_pdf(properties)

problems along the way:
1. child entities that describes holes can also be non line entities.
Example:
    * Circle
so this should also be supported.

Test cases (Pre Processor):
CREATION OF GEOMETRY
Case #1: - PASS (will detect the profile and the hole)
    * single profile
    * Profile is made of polyline (lines and arcs)
    * there are polyline holes
Case #2: - PASS (will detect the profile and the hole)
    * single profile
    * profile is made of polylines (lines and arcs)
    * there are circle holes
Case #3: - PASS (it will detect the profile and should have no holes)
    * single profile
    * profile is made of poylines
    * does not have holes
Case #4: - LIMITATION (it will not detect the profile and will Detect the holes as profiles)
    * single profile
    * profile is not made of poylines (purely circle)
    * does not have holes
Case #5: - will not detect the profile and will not detect the holes as profiles
    * single profile
    * profile is not made of poylines (purely circle)
    * does have holes
Case #6: - PASS (will detect 2 profiles with holes)
    * two profiles touching
    * profile 1 and profile 2 is made of polylines
    * profile 1 and profile 2 has polyline holes
Case #7: - PASS (will only detect profile 1)
    * two profiles touching
    * profile 1 is made of polylines and profile 2 is not made of polylines
    * profile 1 and profile 2 has polyline holes

Assumptions:
1. This assumes that the profiles are made of
polylines. else it wont be detected.
2. supported entities as holes : polylines and circle

forms of the Report:
1. long version
2. short version
3. long version + material details
4. long version + material details + weighted
5. short version + material details
6. short version + material details + weighted

Post-Processor Testcase:
1. Long, No Material
2. Short, No Material
3. Long, 1 Material
4. Short, 1 Material
5. Long, 2 Material
6. Short, 2 Material
7. Long, 2 Material, Weighted
8. Short, 2 Material, Weighted

Note: 1 DXF File = 1 PDF File

Problem to resolve:
1. does not detect hole between two touching Profiles
2. Inconsistent number of material to the number of profile inside the dxf file.
    2.1 material = 0, profile = 2 -> no materials will be implemented on the profiles
    2.2 material = 1, profile = 2 -> material will be used on the both profiles
    2.3 material = 2, profile = 2 -> material 1 to profile 1, material 2 to profile 2
    2.4 material = 2, profile = 3 -> material 1 to profile 1, material 2 to profile 2,
                                     material 2 to profile 3.
3. resolve all "None" in report.
4. inconsistent spacing in report
