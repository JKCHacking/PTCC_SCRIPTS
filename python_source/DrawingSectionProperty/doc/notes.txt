* this accepts the following input from the user:
    1. -f = filepath (but this will be change as it will get the files from the input/ directory)
    2. -m =


Classes:
1. SectionPropertyScript
    * parse_inputs()
    * iter_input()
2. Pre-Processor
    * create_geometry(model_space)
    * create_mesh(geometry, mesh_size)
    * create_materials(material_list)
3. Solver
    * create_section(geometry, mesh, materials)
    * calculate_properties(cross_section)
4. Post-Processor
    * get_properties(cross_section)
    * create_pdf(properties)

problems along the way:
1. child entities that describes holes can also be non line entities.
Example:
    * Circle
so this should also be supported.

Test cases (Pre Processor):
CREATION OF GEOMETRY
Case #1: - PASS (will detect the profile and the hole)
    * single profile
    * Profile is made of polyline (lines and arcs)
    * there are polyline holes
Case #2: - PASS (will detect the profile and the hole)
    * single profile
    * profile is made of polylines (lines and arcs)
    * there are circle holes
Case #3: - PASS (it will detect the profile and should have no holes)
    * single profile
    * profile is made of poylines
    * does not have holes
Case #4: - LIMITATION (it will not detect the profile and will Detect the holes as profiles)
    * single profile
    * profile is not made of poylines (purely circle)
    * does not have holes
Case #5: - will not detect the profile and will not detect the holes as profiles
    * single profile
    * profile is not made of poylines (purely circle)
    * does have holes
Case #6: - PASS (will detect 2 profiles with holes)
    * two profiles touching
    * profile 1 and profile 2 is made of polylines
    * profile 1 and profile 2 has polyline holes
Case #7: - PASS (will only detect profile 1)
    * two profiles touching
    * profile 1 is made of polylines and profile 2 is not made of polylines
    * profile 1 and profile 2 has polyline holes

Assumptions:
1. This assumes that the profiles are made of
polylines. else it wont be detected.
2. supported entities as holes : polylines and circle
