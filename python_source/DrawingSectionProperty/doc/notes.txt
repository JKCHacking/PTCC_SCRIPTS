problems along the way:
1. child entities that describes holes can also be non line entities.
Example:
    * Circle
so this should also be supported.

Test cases (Pre Processor):
CREATION OF GEOMETRY
Case #1: - PASS (will detect the profile and the hole)
    * single profile
    * Profile is made of polyline (lines and arcs)
    * there are polyline holes
Case #2: - PASS (will detect the profile and the hole)
    * single profile
    * profile is made of polylines (lines and arcs)
    * there are circle holes
Case #3: - PASS (it will detect the profile and should have no holes)
    * single profile
    * profile is made of poylines
    * does not have holes
Case #4: - LIMITATION (it will not detect the profile and will Detect the holes as profiles)
    * single profile
    * profile is not made of poylines (purely circle)
    * does not have holes
Case #5: - will not detect the profile and will not detect the holes as profiles
    * single profile
    * profile is not made of poylines (purely circle)
    * does have holes
Case #6: - PASS (will detect 2 profiles with holes)
    * two profiles touching
    * profile 1 and profile 2 is made of polylines
    * profile 1 and profile 2 has polyline holes
Case #7: - PASS (will only detect profile 1)
    * two profiles touching
    * profile 1 is made of polylines and profile 2 is not made of polylines
    * profile 1 and profile 2 has polyline holes

Assumptions:
1. This assumes that the profiles are made of
polylines. else it wont be detected.
2. supported entities as holes : polylines and circle

forms of the Report:
1. long version
2. short version
3. long version + material details
4. long version + material details + weighted
5. short version + material details
6. short version + material details + weighted

Post-Processor Testcase:
1. Long, No Material
2. Short, No Material
3. Long, 1 Material
4. Short, 1 Material
5. Long, 2 Material
6. Short, 2 Material
7. Long, 2 Material, Weighted
8. Short, 2 Material, Weighted

Note: 1 DXF File = 1 PDF File

Problem to resolve:
1. does not detect hole between two touching Profiles
2. Inconsistent number of material to the number of profile inside the dxf file.
    2.1 material = 0, profile = 2 -> no materials will be implemented on the profiles
    2.2 material = 1, profile = 2 -> material will be used on the both profiles
    2.3 material = 2, profile = 2 -> material 1 to profile 1, material 2 to profile 2
    2.4 material = 2, profile = 3 -> material 1 to profile 1, material 2 to profile 2,
                                     material 2 to profile 3.
3. resolve all "None" in report.
4. inconsistent spacing in report


How to get the holes if there are contacts between two profile?
1. Get all the contact points
2. sort all the contact points (^ x and ^ y)
3.

* We cannot use bounding boxes because there are instance where bounding box overlap.
*
Solution 1:
1. Get all the contact points then scan all the points in line with the contacts points.
check each points if they are outside
