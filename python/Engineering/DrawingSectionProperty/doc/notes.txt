problems along the way:
1. child entities that describes holes can also be non line entities.
Example:
    * Circle
so this should also be supported.

Test cases (Pre Processor):
CREATION OF GEOMETRY
Case #1: - PASS (will detect the profile and the hole)
    * single profile
    * Profile is made of polyline (lines and arcs)
    * there are polyline holes
Case #2: - PASS (will detect the profile and the hole)
    * single profile
    * profile is made of polylines (lines and arcs)
    * there are circle holes
Case #3: - PASS (it will detect the profile and should have no holes)
    * single profile
    * profile is made of poylines
    * does not have holes
Case #4: - LIMITATION (it will not detect the profile and will Detect the holes as profiles)
    * single profile
    * profile is not made of poylines (purely circle)
    * does not have holes
Case #5: - will not detect the profile and will not detect the holes as profiles
    * single profile
    * profile is not made of poylines (purely circle)
    * does have holes
Case #6: - PASS (will detect 2 profiles with holes)
    * two profiles touching
    * profile 1 and profile 2 is made of polylines
    * profile 1 and profile 2 has polyline holes
Case #7: - PASS (will only detect profile 1)
    * two profiles touching
    * profile 1 is made of polylines and profile 2 is not made of polylines
    * profile 1 and profile 2 has polyline holes

Assumptions:
1. This assumes that the profiles are made of
polylines. else it wont be detected.
2. supported entities as holes : polylines and circle

forms of the Report:
1. long version
2. short version

4. Short, 1 Material
5. Long, 2 Material
6. Short, 2 Material
7. Long, 2 Material, Weighted

Note: 1 DXF File = 1 PDF File

Problem to resolve:
1. does not detect hole between two touching Profiles -> DONE
2. Inconsistent number of material to the number of profile inside the dxf file. -> DONE
    2.1 material = 0, profile = 2 -> no materials will be implemented on the profiles -> DONE
    2.2 material = 1, profile = 2 -> material 1 will be used on the both profiles -> DONE
    2.3 material = 2, profile = 2 -> material 1 to profile 1, material 2 to profile 2 -> DONE
    2.4 material = 2, profile = 3 -> material 1 to profile 1, material 2 to profile 2, -> DONE
                                     material 2 to profile 3.
    2.5 material = 3, profile = 2 -> material 1 to profile 1, material 2 to profile 2, -> DONE
                                     material 3 will be disregarded.
3. resolve all "None" in report.
    3.1 Extreme Fiber centroidal distances for bending about geometric axes -> [/] calculate_extreme_fibres(0) -> DONE
    3.2 Elastic section modulus about geometric axes -> [/] get_z() -> DONE
    3.3 Extreme fiber centroidal distances for bending about principal axes -> [/] calculate_extreme_fibres(phi) -> DONE
    3.4 Elastic section modulus about principal axes -> [/]get_zp() -> DONE
    3.5 Shear center coordinates wrt centroid [???] -> inconsistent output (removed)
    3.6 Principal axis shear center coor. wrt centroid [???] -> inconsistent output (removed)
    3.7 Plastic section modulus about geometric axes -> geometric = centroidal [???] [/] get_s() -> DONE
    3.8 Plastic section modulus about principal axes [/] get_sp() -> DONE
4. inconsistent spacing in report -> To be resolved later


How to get the holes if there are contacts between two profile?
1. Get all the contact points
2. sort all the contact points (^ x and ^ y)

* We cannot use bounding boxes because there are instance where bounding box overlap.

Solution 1:
* Get all the contact points then scan all the points in line with the contacts points.
check each points if they are outside

Test case for script:
1. Long, No Material
2. Short, No Material
3. Long, 1 Material
4. Short, 1 Material
5. Long, 2 Material
6. Short, 2 Material
7. Long, 2 Material, Weighted
8. Short, 2 Material, Weighted
9. Long, 2 File, File1 = 1 Profile, File2 = 1 Profile, No Material
10. Short, 2 File, File1 = 1 Profile, File2 = 1 Profile, No Material
11. Long, 2 File, File1 = 1 Profile, File2 = 1 Profile, 2 Material
12. Long, 2 File, File1 = 1 Profile, File2 = 1 Profile, 1 Material
13. Long, 2 File, File1 = 1 Profile, File2 = 1 Profile, 3 Material
14. Long, 2 File, File1 = 1 Profile, File2 = 2 Profile, 3 Material
15. Long, 2 File, File1 = 1 Profile, File2 = 2 Profile, 2 Material
16. Long, 2 File, File1 = 1 Profile, File2 = 2 Profile, 4 Material

Changes:
1. It outputs 1 PDF = 1 DXF File. (You need to put profiles inside file)
This is better because you can easily control the output pdf file especially if you
have alot of dxf files as input.
2. removed the -files parameter. instead expect the input files
in the input folder and output files in the output folder.
3. changed the module structure to make them testable
4. added alot of test cases. test folder

5. Notes to consider:
For Inconsistent number of material to the number of profile inside the dxf file.
    2.1 material = 0, profile = 2 -> no materials will be implemented on the profiles
    2.2 material = 1, profile = 2 -> material 1 will be used on the both profiles
    2.3 material = 2, profile = 2 -> material 1 to profile 1, material 2 to profile 2
    2.4 material = 2, profile = 3 -> material 1 to profile 1, material 2 to profile 2,
                                     material 2 to profile 3.
    2.5 material = 3, profile = 2 -> material 1 to profile 1, material 2 to profile 2,
                                     material 3 will be disregarded.
6. Used Pymupdf as the PDF handler package for the script. (might change to reportlab in the future to support tabbing)
to install: pip install PyMuPDF

Usage:
1. copy dxf file to input folder
2. run the script command
3. check the output folder for the output report pdf.

Sample Script command:

1.
+----# for long report and profiles expected to have holes.
+----python path/to/DrawingSectionProperty/main.py -long -hole

2.
+----# for short report and profiles expected to have holes.
+----python path/to/DrawingSectionProperty/main.py -hole
