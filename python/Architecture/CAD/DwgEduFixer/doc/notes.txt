Solution:
1. DWG to PDF
	convert dwg to pdf
	scan pdf with string "STUDENT"
	mark dwg file as student

2. open trueview or use autocad
	open drawing in autocad/DWG TrueView
	For TrueView we should use pywinauto for automation since
	AcCtrl.dll does not work (or What I believe, from my experience)
	check for dialogs

According here:

AcCtrl.dll is useless if you dont have Autocad installed.

during opening of a file: (DWG TRUEVIEW APPLICATION)
* either a file is loading to open
    * we wait until file is fully loaded
    * for it to be loaded, file_name_count == 2.
        * we have to check if file_name is in tv_app.windows() list every 0.5 seconds.
        * increment file_name_count by 1 if it exists.
* or a dialog box is displayed (dialog boxes are instantaneous)
    * student version dialog box appears
